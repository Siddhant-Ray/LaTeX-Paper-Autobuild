# LaTeX-Paper-Autobuild

Always struggled with finding a good solution to automate builds and track versions while writing a paper in LaTeX. Well, I decided to write one myself. Overleaf is one nice solution where you don't have to worry about anything, till it goes down for maintenance at the very time you need to make a crucial update (jk we all love Overleaf don't we). Compiling locally is always nice, auto-building and version tracking for it is even better. Plus I thought I could support some custom builds too.

TeX files and compiling scripts.

Default builds:

* Latest compiled pdf : [main.pdf]

Advanced builds:

* Greyscale pdf : [main_grey.pdf])
* No appendix : [main_no-appendix.pdf]
* No acknowledgements : [main_no-acknowledgements.pdf]
